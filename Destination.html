<p>To me, a lot of things have changed, i think that as i grow older, the more things i started
disliking, and likig. So it's very difficult to tell which one would stay with me and which one
would be temporary, but one thing is certain, and it's that coding games, and seeing people who
enjoyed my game have fun is very sweet and rewarding for me, it's the reason why I'm at I.T</p>

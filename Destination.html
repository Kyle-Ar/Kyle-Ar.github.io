<p>To me, a lot of things have changed, i think that as i grow older, the more things i started
disliking, and likig. So it's very difficult to tell which one would stay with me and which one
would be temporary, but one thing is certain, and it's that coding games, and seeing people who
enjoyed my game have fun is very sweet and rewarding for me, it's the reason why I'm at I.T</p>

        <h1>School Projects</h1>
<p>well throughout my school life, there were tons of assignments, projects and group meetings 
that I had to participate in, most of them were simple and easy while others are quiet difficult
and challenging that all of them to me is just this one huge blur, one thing that I do remember
was winning a golden medal on my S.I.P project, however I heavily credit the team other than me
myself.</p>

        <h1>Talents</h1>
<p>I like to think that my confidence would be part of a talent, I think it's the self acceptance
and love for myself is what caused my own self confidence to flourish, because of this I feel quiet
confident In reportingss, however it still did not cure my nervousness, I take great pleassure on 
knowing what I can provide in group projects and roles.</p>
